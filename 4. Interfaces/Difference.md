Hereâ€™s a simple table comparing **Abstract Classes** and **Interfaces** in Java:

| **Feature**             | **Abstract Class**                            | **Interface**                                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Methods**             | Can have both abstract methods (without code) and concrete methods (with code). | Can only have abstract methods (until Java 8) or default/static methods (Java 8+). |
| **Fields**              | Can have instance variables (fields).         | Can only have `public static final` constants (fields). |
| **Access Modifiers**    | Can have any access modifiers (public, private, protected). | All methods are `public` by default. |
| **Constructor**         | Can have constructors.                        | Cannot have constructors.                   |
| **Inheritance**         | A class can extend only one abstract class.   | A class can implement multiple interfaces.  |
| **Purpose**             | Used for classes that share common behavior but also have some differences. | Used to define a contract (behavior) for any class to follow. |
| **Multiple Inheritance**| No (single inheritance, one class can extend only one abstract class). | Yes (can implement multiple interfaces).   |
| **Default Methods**     | Cannot have default methods (methods with code) before Java 8. | Can have default methods (Java 8+), providing default behavior. |
| **Static Methods**      | Can have static methods.                     | Can have static methods (Java 8+).          |
| **Instantiability**     | Cannot be instantiated directly, but can have state (fields). | Cannot be instantiated; only defines methods and constants. |

### **Summary**
- **Abstract Class**: Use when you want to share code among related classes and have some common behavior.
- **Interface**: Use when you want to define a contract that different classes can follow, without forcing them into a common parent class.
