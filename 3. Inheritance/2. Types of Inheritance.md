In Java, inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows one class (child class) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (parent class). Java supports different types of inheritance which are:

### 1. **Single Inheritance**
- In single inheritance, a class inherits from only one superclass. This is the most basic type of inheritance.
- **Example**: A child class `Dog` inherits from the parent class `Animal`.

#### Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        myDog.bark(); // Specific to Dog class
    }
}
```

### 2. **Multilevel Inheritance**
- In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from a child class that is also derived from another class, forming a chain of inheritance.
- **Example**: Class `Puppy` inherits from class `Dog`, which in turn inherits from class `Animal`.

#### Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

class Puppy extends Dog {
    void play() {
        System.out.println("Puppy plays.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Puppy myPuppy = new Puppy();
        myPuppy.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        myPuppy.bark(); // Inherited from Dog
        myPuppy.play(); // Specific to Puppy
    }
}
```

### 3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
- In hierarchical inheritance, multiple classes inherit from the same parent class.
- **Example**: Both `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from the `Animal` class.

#### Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        Cat myCat = new Cat();

        myDog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        myDog.bark(); // Specific to Dog

        myCat.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        myCat.meow(); // Specific to Cat
    }
}
```

### 4. **Hybrid Inheritance**
- **Hybrid inheritance** is a combination of more than one type of inheritance (for example, single and multiple inheritance).
- Java **does not** directly support hybrid inheritance with classes due to the **"diamond problem"** that occurs with multiple inheritance. However, hybrid inheritance can be achieved using **interfaces**.
  
#### Example Using Interfaces:
```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
}

interface Canine {
    void bark();
}

class Dog implements Animal, Canine {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog eats food.");
    }

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();  // From Animal interface
        myDog.bark(); // From Canine interface
    }
}
```
In the example above, `Dog` implements two interfaces (`Animal` and `Canine`), combining multiple inheritance-like behavior with interfaces.

### Summary of Types of Inheritance:

| **Type of Inheritance**  | **Description**                                                                 | **Supported in Java**   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Single Inheritance**    | One class inherits from one parent class.                                        | Yes                     |
| **Multilevel Inheritance**| A chain of inheritance, where a class is derived from another derived class.     | Yes                     |
| **Hierarchical Inheritance** | Multiple classes inherit from the same parent class.                         | Yes                     |
| **Hybrid Inheritance**    | Combination of different types of inheritance. Achieved through interfaces.      | Yes (with interfaces)    |

### **Diamond Problem and Why Multiple Inheritance is Not Allowed in Java**
- **Diamond Problem**: If a class is allowed to inherit from multiple parent classes, and those parent classes have a method with the same signature, the compiler wouldn’t know which method to use. This ambiguity is called the **diamond problem**.
- To avoid this problem, Java does not support **multiple inheritance** with classes but allows it through **interfaces**, which don’t have method implementations in the same way classes do.
