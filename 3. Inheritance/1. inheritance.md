Let's dive into **inheritance** in Java, starting from the basics to help you prepare for your exam.

### 1. **What is Inheritance?**
- **Inheritance** is when one class (child class) **inherits** properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent class).
- This allows you to **reuse code** and build upon existing functionality.

### 2. **Why Use Inheritance?**
- **Code Reusability**: You don’t need to rewrite the same methods or attributes multiple times.
- **Maintainability**: Changes made to the parent class automatically reflect in the child class.
- **Extensibility**: You can extend the functionality of existing classes without modifying them directly.

### 3. **How Inheritance Works in Java?**
- The child class inherits all **public** and **protected** members (fields and methods) of the parent class.
- It uses the **extends** keyword.

#### Example:
Let’s say we have a parent class `Animal` and a child class `Dog`.

```java
// Parent Class (SuperClass)
class Animal {
    // Method in the parent class
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Child Class (SubClass)
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Additional method in the child class
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

// Main class to test inheritance
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        
        // Inherited method from Animal class
        myDog.eat();  // Output: This animal eats food.
        
        // Method specific to Dog class
        myDog.bark(); // Output: The dog barks.
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- The `Dog` class **inherits** the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class, so it can use that method.
- `Dog` also has its own method `bark()`.
